# Local Server that Connects to Local Databse Through HTTPS Requests

This project was created to practice the creation of simple servers locally and their connection to databases. This projects uses Express.JS for the server creation including the Pool library to connect to the Postgres database.

In order for this code to work on your device you will need Postgres installed as well as the Express library for JS. You will need to have a pre populated database on Postgres locally to access using the created functions.

Enjoy!
